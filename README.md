<p>This website allows you to collect and share your beer tasting feelings with other users. It's a kind of beer-geek's diary. The website is built with using python's framework - flask and some bootstrap 5. It's my first version of the website and I am going to add more content and functionalities from time to time. If you want to see more my projects check my github account. All my socials links you can find below. </p>
